1. Our best model is the MNB model. To get the accuracy for the Kaggle submission, run the MultinomialNaiveBayes.ipynb. You will see the validation scores in the second last cell. To get the CSV file, just run the last cell and the predictions will be downloaded into a new CSV file. 

2. For all the other models, just run their respective python files/notebooks. Make sure that the training data file is in the same directory. 

3. We used SciKit learn for all the models except our implementation of the Naive Bayes model.
